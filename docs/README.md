# IBC-Go Documentation

Welcome to the IBC-Go documentation! This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Docs Build Workflow

The documentation for IBC-Go is hosted at <https://ibc.cosmos.network>.

built from the files in this (`/docs`) directory for
[main](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/docs).

## docusaurus.config.js

Docusaurus configuration file is located at `./docusaurus.config.js`. This file contains the configuration for the sidebar, navbar, footer, and other settings. Sidebars are created in `./sidebars.js`.

## Links

**NOTE:** Strongly consider the existing links - both within this directory
and to the website docs - when moving or deleting files.

Relative links should be used nearly everywhere, having discovered and weighed the following:

### Relative

Where is the other file, relative to the current one?

- works both on GitHub and for the VuePress build
- confusing / annoying to have things like: `../../../../myfile.md`
- requires more updates when files are re-shuffled

### Absolute

Where is the other file, given the root of the repo?

- works on GitHub, doesn't work for the VuePress build
- this is much nicer: `/docs/hereitis/myfile.md`
- if you move that file around, the links inside it are preserved (but not to it, of course)

### Full

The full GitHub URL to a file or directory. Used occasionally when it makes sense
to send users to the GitHub.

## Building Locally

### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Local Development

```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Search

<!-- ## Consistency

Because the build processes are identical (as is the information contained herein), this file should be kept in sync as
much as possible with its [counterpart in the Cosmos SDK repo](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/README.md). -->

## Updating the Documentation

The documentation is autogenerated from the markdown files found in [docs](./docs) directory. Each directory in `./docs` represents a category to be displayed in the sidebar. If you create a new directory, you must create a `_category_.json` file in that directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "label": "Sidebar Label",
  "position": 1, // position of the category in the sidebar
  "link": null
}
```

If you create a new markdown file within a category (`.docs/` directory is itself a category), you must add the following frontmatter to the top of the markdown file:

```yaml
---
title: Title of the file # title of the file in the sidebar
sidebar_label: Sidebar Label # title of the file in the sidebar
sidebar_position: 1 # position of the file in the sidebar
slug: /migrations/v5-to-v6 # the url of the file
---
```

### File and Directory Naming Conventions

Inside `./docs`:

- All files should be named in `kebab-case`.
- All files should have a two digit prefix, indicating the order in which they should be read and displayed in their respective categories. For example, `01-overview.md` should be read before `02-integration.md`. If this order changes, the prefix should be updated. Note that the ordering is enforced by the frontmatter and not the file name.
- **All files that end in `.template.md` will be ignored by the build process.**
- All category directories should be named in `kebab-case`.
- All category directories must have a `_category_.json` file.
- All category directories should have a two digit prefix (except for the root `./docs` category), indicating the order in which they should be read and displayed in their respective categories. For example, `01-overview.md` should be read before `02-integration.md`. If this order changes, the prefix should be updated. Note that the ordering is enforced by the frontmatter and not the file name.
