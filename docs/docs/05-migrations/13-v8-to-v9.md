# Migrating from v8 to v9

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

### API removals

The `exported.ChannelI` and `exported.CounterpartyChannelI` interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.
The `exported.ConnectionI` and `exported.CounterpartyConnectionI` interfaces have been removed. Please use the concrete types.

The functions `GetState()`, `GetOrdering()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetConnectionHops()`, `GetVersion()` of the `Channel` type have been removed.
The functions `GetPortID()`, `GetChannelID()` of the `CounterpartyChannel` type have been removed.
The functions `GetClientID()`, `GetState()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetVersions()`, and `GetDelayPeriod` of the `Connection` type have been removed. 
The functions `GetClientID()`, `GetConnectionID()`, and `GetPrefix()` of the `CounterpartyConnection` type have been removed. 

### API deprecation notice

The testing package functions `coordinator.Setup`, `coordinator.SetupClients`, `coordinator.SetupConnections`, `coordinator.CreateConnections`, and `coordinator.CreateChannels` have been deprecated and will be removed in v10.
Please use the new functions `path.Setup`, `path.SetupClients`, `path.SetupConnections`, `path.CreateConnections`, `path.CreateChannels`.

### IBC testing package

- The `mock.PV` type has been removed in favour of [`cmttypes.MockPV`](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.5/types/priv_validator.go#L50) ([#5709](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5709)).
- Functions `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeader` and `ConstructUpdateTMClientHeaderWithTrustedHeight` of `TestChain` type have been replaced with `IBCClientHeader`. This function will construct a `07-tendermint` header to update the light client on the counterparty chain. The trusted height must be passed in as a non-zero height.
- `GetValsAtHeight` has been renamed to `GetTrustedValidators`

## Relayers

- Renaming of event attribute keys in [#5603](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5603).

## IBC Light Clients

### API removals

The `ExportMetadata` interface function has been removed from the `ClientState` interface. Core IBC will export all key/value's within the 02-client store.  

### 07-tendermint

The `IterateConsensusMetadata` function has been removed.

### 08-wasm

The `ExportMetadataMsg` struct has been removed and is no longer required for contracts to implement. Core IBC will handle exporting all key/value's written to the store by a light client contract.
The `ZeroCustomFields` interface function has been removed from the `ClientState` interface. Core IBC only used this function to set tendermint client states when scheduling an IBC software upgrade. The interface function has been replaced by a type assertion.
