# Migrating from v8 to v9

This guide provides instructions for migrating to a new version of ibc-go.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:

- [Chains](#chains)
- [IBC Apps](#ibc-apps)
- [Relayers](#relayers)
- [IBC Light Clients](#ibc-light-clients)

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated on major version releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

### API removals

The `exported.ChannelI` interface has been removed. Please use the concrete type. 

The functions `GetState()`, `GetOrdering()`, `GetCounterparty()`, `GetConnectionHops()`, `GetVersion()` of the `Channel` type have been removed.

## Relayers

- Renaming of event attribute keys in [#5603](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5603).

## IBC Light Clients

- No relevant changes were made in this release.
