# Migrating from v2.0.0 to v3.0.0

This document is intended to highlight significant changes which may require more information than presented in the CHANGELOG.
Any changes that must be done by a user of ibc-go should be documented here.

There are four sections based on the four potential user groups of this document:
- Chains
- IBC Apps
- Relayers
- IBC Light Clients

**Note:** ibc-go supports golang semantic versioning and therefore all imports must be updated to bump the version number on major releases.

## Chains

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Apps

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## Relayers

- No relevant changes were made in this release.

## IBC Light Clients

The `CheckMisbehaviourAndUpdateState` function has been modified. The client state return value has been removed. 

Light clients **must** set the updated client state in the client store before returning for valid misbehaviour.
